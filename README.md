# About the plugin

Arsenic was made by me, MiSkynet. The basic idea was to create a
shop plugin that's easy to use but customizable. Currently,
the plugin was only tested in the Minecraft version 1.21.4, but
I'll keep going testing to see, what version its currently working on.


# Download

### Relases

The plugin can be found at the following locations: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MiSkynet/Arsenic/releases/) (more will follow)

Simply download the latest version of the plugin. After downloading, just drag the **.jar** into your servers **plugin folder** and give it a quick restart with **/restart**.
You can find the configuration files in /plugins/arsenic. If anything should break, just delete the file, or the complete folder and restart the server. Now all files should be created again in default state.


# Vault

The plugin currently uses only Vault for economy support. Therefore, Vault **must** be installed for the plugin to work. If Vault is not installed, the plugin will disable itself and prompt the user to install Vault.
Vault can be found [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/). Additionally, Vault requires an economy provider such as [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/)!


# Wiki

The wiki will follow in a few days and will provide more details about placeholders and the plugin itself.
